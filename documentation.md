# Simple Legal Assistant Documentation

## Overview
This is a simplified version of a legal document assistant that uses a two-agent architecture to process and respond to queries about legal documents. The system is designed to be memory-efficient and run on CPU-only environments, making it suitable for deployment on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces.

## System Architecture

### 1. Multi-Agent Pipeline
The system uses two specialized agents working in tandem:

#### Query Agent
- **Purpose**: Handles document processing and information retrieval
- **Components**:
  - Document Loader: Processes PDFs in batches
  - Text Chunker: Splits documents into manageable pieces
  - Search Engine: Finds relevant information using embeddings

#### Summarization Agent
- **Purpose**: Creates concise, readable summaries
- **Components**:
  - Key Point Extractor: Identifies important information
  - Sentence Scorer: Ranks sentences by relevance
  - Summary Generator: Creates coherent summaries

### 2. Document Processing

#### PDF Loading
- Maximum 50 pages per document
- Processes documents in batches of 10
- Shows progress with emoji indicators (üìö, üìÑ, üîç)
- Handles errors gracefully with clear messages

#### Text Chunking
- Splits text into 500-character chunks
- Maintains sentence boundaries
- Ensures readability of chunks
- Optimizes for search efficiency

### 3. Search and Retrieval

#### Embedding Model
- Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for text embeddings
- Lightweight and efficient for CPU processing
- Provides good semantic search capabilities

#### Search Process
- Performs cosine similarity search
- Returns top 3 most relevant chunks
- Combines results for comprehensive response

### 4. Summarization Process

#### Key Point Extraction
- Analyzes retrieved chunks
- Identifies important sentences
- Considers:
  - Sentence length
  - Position in text
  - Keyword presence

#### Sentence Scoring
- Scores based on multiple factors:
  - Keyword matches
  - Sentence length
  - Position in text
- Combines scores for final ranking

#### Summary Generation
- Selects top 4 sentences
- Maintains coherence
- Formats for readability

- Memory usage: ~4GB RAM

## Usage Guide

### 1. Starting the Application
```bash
python app.py
```
The application will start and be available at `http://localhost:7860`

### 2. Using the Interface
1. Upload PDF documents (max 50 pages each)
2. Enter your query in the text box
3. Click "Submit" to process
4. View results in the response area

### 3. Understanding the Output
- Search Results: Most relevant document chunks
- Summary: Concise overview of key points
- Error Messages: Clear explanations if something goes wrong

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
1. **Document Processing**
   - File too large
   - Invalid PDF format
   - Empty documents

2. **Search Issues**
   - No relevant matches
   - Query too vague
   - Document not loaded

3. **Summary Problems**
   - Insufficient content
   - Processing errors
   - Memory constraints

### Error Recovery
- Automatic retries for processing
- Fallback responses
- Clear error messages
- Graceful degradation

## Best Practices

### Document Preparation
- Keep PDFs under 50 pages
- Ensure text is readable
- Use standard formatting
- Avoid scanned documents

### Query Formulation
- Be specific
- Use relevant keywords
- Keep queries concise
- Focus on key concepts

### Performance Tips
- Process documents in batches
- Monitor memory usage
- Clear cache when needed
- Regular maintenance
